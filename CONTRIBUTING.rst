articles, and such.

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/rdnfn/bauwerk/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

  are welcome :)

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `bauwerk` for local development.

1. Fork the `bauwerk` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/bauwerk.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv bauwerk
    $ cd bauwerk/
    $ python setup.py develop

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the
   tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ flake8 bauwerk tests
    $ python setup.py test or pytest
    $ tox

   To get flake8 and tox, just pip install them into your virtualenv.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8, and for PyPy. Check
   https://travis-ci.com/rdnfn/bauwerk/pull_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

$ pytest tests.test_bauwerk

Deploying
---------

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy. Follow this checklist (inspired by `this checklist <https://gist.github.com/audreyfeldroy/5990987>`_ and `this packaging tutorial <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/>`_):

1. Update ``HISTORY.rst`` and commit with message like "aux: add changelog for upcoming release 0.1.0"
2. Run

    .. code-block:: console

        bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch

3. Push commits *and tags* (`see here how to do this in vscode <https://stackoverflow.com/a/66086007>`_)
4. Merge pull request into ``main`` branch.
5. Add release on GitHub (using existing tag)
