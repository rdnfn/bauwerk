Bauwerk is a Python package that provides super simple reinforcement learning environments representing controllable buildings. In each of the included buildings the charging rate of the home battery can be controlled.

Features
========

- **Many buildings:** Bauwerk provides access to buildings with varying sizes and devices.
- **Optimal control:** the building simulations are based on fully tractable optimisation problems. Therefore, you can compute the best possible policy and compare your algorithm to a rigorous benchmark.
- **Game:** building control problems can be unintuitive to humans. Bauwerk provides a game interface to the environment that allows for a more intuitive understanding of the problems. This game aims to help intuitively understand and explain the problems.
