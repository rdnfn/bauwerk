    "- **Solar photovoltaic installation**: provides energy when the sun allows for it but can't be directly controlled.\n",
    "- **Residential electrical load**: represents energy usage that needs to be covered but can't be controlled.\n",
    "- **Grid connection**: allows to buy or sell energy to the grid, can't be controlled directly. All energy needs of the system must be satisfied and energy will be bought automatically accordingly. Similarly, excess energy is automatically sold.\n",

The boundaries $-1.0$ and $1.0$ represent (approximately) the maximum amount the battery can be discharged/charged in a single time step. Note that (dis-)charging by these maximum amounts may often not be possible. In this case, the closest action will be taken. For example, if the battery is almost full, action $1.0$ may actually result in charging as if action $0.1$ was given. \n",
