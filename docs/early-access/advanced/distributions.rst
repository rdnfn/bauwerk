Building distributions
======================

Besides the standard Gym environments, Bauwerk also provides distributions
over buildings.


API
---


For this purpose Bauwerk follows a simplified version of the API of the widely
used Meta-RL library `MetaWorld <https://github.com/rlworkgroup/metaworld>`_.

.. code-block:: python

    build_dist_b = bauwerk.benchmarks.BuildDistB()

    training_envs = []
    for task in build_dist_b.train_tasks:
        env = build_dist_b.make_env()
        env.set_task(task)
        training_envs.append(env)

    for env in training_envs:
        env.reset()
        act = env.action_space.sample()
        env.step(act)



Further, Benchmark also support the full
`MetaWorld <https://github.com/rlworkgroup/metaworld>`_ API. Note that this is for
compatibility reasons, and in many use-cases unnecessarily complex as all Bauwerk
Benchmarks only have a single environment class.

.. code-block:: python

    # Construct the benchmark, sampling tasks
    build_dist_b = bauwerk.benchmarks.BuildDistB()

    training_envs = []
    for name, env_cls in build_dist_b.train_classes.items():
        env = env_cls()
        task = random.choice(
            [task for task in build_dist_b.train_tasks if task.env_name == name]
        )
        env.set_task(task)
        training_envs.append(env)

    for env in training_envs:
        env.reset()
        act = env.action_space.sample()
        env.step(act)

Each Bauwerk building distribution implements (and accept arguments of) the following class:

.. autoclass:: bauwerk.benchmarks.BuildDist

Available distributions
-----------------------

Bauwerk provides a number of building distributions, each with increasing technical difficulty. The first and easiest distribution, A, always samples the same identical building. The next distribution, B, samples houses with different battery sizes, but keeps the house otherwise identical. The other distributions follow a similar pattern, each adding a bit more complexity to the problem. See the descriptions below for more details on each distribution.

.. figure:: /assets/bauwerk_build_dist_abcd.png

    Illustration of Bauwerk distributions *A*, *B*, *C* and *D* in building parameter space. Each adds one dimension of variability. Distribution *A* samples always the same home, *B* samples from a line (of varying battery sizes), and so on.

.. warning::

    Bauwerk is at an early stage of development and the specific configurations of these distributions may change. Always mention the Bauwerk version when reporting results on Bauwerk benchmarks.


.. autoclass:: bauwerk.benchmarks.BuildDistA
.. autoclass:: bauwerk.benchmarks.BuildDistB
.. autoclass:: bauwerk.benchmarks.BuildDistC
.. autoclass:: bauwerk.benchmarks.BuildDistD
.. autoclass:: bauwerk.benchmarks.BuildDistE



Custom distributions
--------------------

It is also possible to create custom distributions in Bauwerk. See the definition of ``BuildDistB`` below as an example:

.. literalinclude:: /../bauwerk/benchmarks.py
   :pyobject: BuildDistB

The main thing is that we need to set a distribution over configurations ``CfgDist`` in the ``__init__`` method. This distribution is very similar to the :class:`bauwerk.EnvConfig` configuration class, other than that it also allows you to set parameters as *distributions*. In the code example above, the ``battery_size`` is set to be continuous parameter distribution :class:`bauwerk.benchmarks.ContParamDist`. See how this distribution class is set up below:

.. literalinclude:: /../bauwerk/benchmarks.py
   :pyobject: ContParamDist

.. literalinclude:: /../bauwerk/benchmarks.py
   :pyobject: ParamDist
